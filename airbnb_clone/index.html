                    <h2>This is not Digital-Virtual Reality. It's Real.</h2>
                    <p>Rent a indivual's unused living space in over 34,000 cities and 192 countries. For the true travel experience, live like a local. Specifically, live your vacation like the permanent resident of your vacation lodgings.</p>

                <h3>Immersion</h3>
                <h4>From apartments and rooms to treehouses and boats: stay in unique spaces in 192 countries. Imagine what the residents who live here typically do and emulate them.</h4>
                <p>Once you arrive at your vacation lodgings, you will first need to learn about the regular occupant of this dwelling. A nice mix of reverse phone book lookups, facebook, their name, and any other data that is easily accessible. Looking through the items in the dwelling is useful too. What type of clothes do they have?</p>

                <h4>Why eat at another uppity posh cafe where everyone has an attitude and the food is always perfect?</h4>
                <p>To really experience the uniqueness of life where you are, eat the local fare. It may take a few days to acclimate to the spicy or fatty food, and the nonpotable water used to cook with may help you log some extra bathroom hours. Remember, new persona eats this every day.</p>
