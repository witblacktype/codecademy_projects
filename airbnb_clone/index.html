                    <h2>This is not Digital-Virtual Reality. It's Real.</h2>
                    <p>Rent an unused living space in over 34,000 cities and 192 countries. For the true travel experience, live like a local. Specifically, live your vacation like the permanent resident of your vacation lodgings.</p>

                <h3>Immersion</h3>
                <h4>From apartments and rooms to treehouses and boats: stay in unique spaces in 192 countries. Imagine what the residents who live here typically do and emulate them.</h4>
                <p>Once you arrive at your vacation lodgings, you will first need to learn about the regular occupant of this dwelling. A nice mix of reverse phone book lookups, Facebook, their name, and any other data that is easily accessible will be useful. Looking through the items in the dwelling is good too. What type of clothes do they have? That is always helpful when there are clothes in closets.</p>

                <h3>Daily Life</h3>
                <h4>Why eat at another uppity posh cafe on your vacation where everyone has an attitude and the food is always perfect?</h4>
                <p>To really experience the uniqueness of life where you are, eat the local fare. It may take a few days to acclimate to the spicy or fatty food, and the nonpotable water used to cook with may help you log some extra bathroom hours. Remember, your new persona eats this every day. Don't forget that your new resident isn't on vacation all the time. Figure out where they work and go do their job for them in their absence.</p>

                <h3>Trust and Safety</h3>
                <h4>Trust will be important to you. So will your safety.</h4>
                <p>As you live the life of someone else, you will come into contact with their regular acquiantances. The easiest way to explain your presence and motivations for doing the same things the normal resident would do is explain, "You are staying there, and you are helping the resident in their absence." I'm sure their boss at work will agree once you do an amazing job at the original resident's work with no training. Safety is paramount when in a new place and looking like a foreigner will likely make you a target for criminals. Wear the resident's clothes - you will definitely fit in now.</p>
